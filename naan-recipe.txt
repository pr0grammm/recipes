naan Recipe

Makes 8 | Prep Time: 20 Mins | Cook Time: 15 Mins
Ingredients:

1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup warm water
1/4 oz active dry yeast
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 tablespoon oil
Some oil, for greasing the skillet
3 tablespoons melted salted butter
Method:

In a small bowl, add the sugar, warm water, and yeast together. Stir to combine well. The yeast should be activated when it becomes foamy, about 10 minutes. Transfer the flour to a flat surface and make a well in the middle. Add the yeast mixture, yoghurt, and oil, knead the dough until the surface becomes smooth and shiny, about 10 minutes. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place (for example: beside the stovetop or warm oven). The dough should double in size, about 1 hour.
